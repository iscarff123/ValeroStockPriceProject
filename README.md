# Valero Stock Price Prediction
### Time of Project: Summer 2018
### Independent Study Project
### Bachelors of Science in Statistics, Texas A&M University

For my first data science project, I was tasked to develop a model to predict the price of Valero stock. 3 ARIMA models for daily, weekly, and monthly values and a linear regression model for daily values were trained and tested. Please see the [VLO Project Report](https://github.com/iscarff123/ValeroStockPriceProject/blob/main/VLO%20Project%20Report.pdf) for more details.
